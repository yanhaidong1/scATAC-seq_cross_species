# scATAC-seq_cross_species

This pipeline comprises essential scripts for conducting cross-species analyses. Generally, it consists of five distinct steps:

Steps 1-2: Thorough characterizations of ACRs, TFs, and motifs for each species.
Step 3: Conducting cross-species analyses using the outcomes from the preceding two steps.
Steps 4-5: Investigating the association of H3K27me3 with ACRs for each species.

Additionally, it incorporates an R script designed to generate the plots featured in the manuscript.

The input file names are specified in the script headers to indicate the precise files that can be utilized for the analyses.
